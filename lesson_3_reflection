When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Whenever it's necessary to collaborate with a work team, everyone can use a remote
  repository to add their own contributions.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You probably want to check oout what changes have been made to a remote before pulling to your local
	directory.
