When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Whenever it's necessary to collaborate with a work team, everyone can use a remote
  repository to add their own contributions.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You probably want to check oout what changes have been made to a remote before pulling to your local
	directory.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork - Clone a repository from GitHub to your own GitHub account
	Clone - Gets a copy from a remote (GitHub) repository to your local directory
	Branch - Makes a parallel version of master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	To keep track of changes that have been made on the remote using git fetch, but not modifying
	your local master branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	-Would be harder to take control of changes and who made those changes?
	-A simple way to collaborate without Git or GitHub is to use Google Drive and share
	folders to contribute.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	Maybe you want to add a new functionality that's not on initial plans, and maybe they won't be on final version.
	So you test on a different branch.
