How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Comparing two versions of a file let you find errors by reading lines that were introduced on the newer file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You learn from the previous errors and work faster.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - You chooise a logical change and commit it.
    Cons - You can forget an important change to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because there are some changes that affect not only one file, but two or more.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    First with the git log command I can see all commits, and with the second command
    git diff, I can see diferences between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It's easy to reverse to a previous version that actually works!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To use with all my upcomming projects and and now work with a version control system.
